# hello-world

Hello corporeal minds!

I call myself the crypt0matr1x because I love cryptocurrencies!

I am a semi public figure that wishes to remain anonymous at this time. 

I have zero knowledge of how to code or develop applications/software. 

But I am here to learn!

My goal is to understand blockchain technology, and gain enough skill to be able to write smart contracts and perhaps develop my own dapps. 

That is all for now. 

Goodbye!
